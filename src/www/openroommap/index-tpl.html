<a href="static/">OpenRoomMap</a> is a system that allows users to
annotate building floor maps with fine-grain positioned furniture, 
appliances and room features, in a user-friendly graphical user 
interface. It can be used for simple tasks such as locating and 
visualizing building rooms and spaces and serves as a recourceful and 
up-to-date database for planning and research into energy
expenditures and optimization.</p>

<p>We want to collect a detailed indoor plan of the Computer
Laboratory and we think that this information is best entered and kept
up to date by building users themselves.  Please use the link below to
launch our editor software which you can use to position furniture and
appliances within the building.</p>

<p>We are interested in as much detail as you are prepared to provide:
the names of the floorboxes in your office, the location of air vents,
the name of your workstation and the position of your desk and
shelving.</p>
